# XFlyve — Transport Automation System

XFlyve is a full-stack logistics automation platform designed to replace spreadsheet-based coordination and manual workflows used by small transport companies.

It automates job assignments, driver workflows, and Proof-of-Delivery (POD) handling, reducing manual administrative work by ~70%.

## Live Demo

- **Backend API:** https://xflyve.onrender.com

## Problem

Before XFlyve, daily operations relied on:

- WhatsApp messages and phone calls  
- Excel sheets updated manually  
- PODs shared informally as images  
- No central system for job tracking  

This caused data loss, duplicated work, and heavy admin overhead.

---

## Solution

XFlyve provides a single internal platform with **role-based access** for admins and drivers, centralizing all operational workflows.

---

## ✨ Features

### Admin
- Manage drivers, trucks, and job assignments  
- View submitted work diaries and PODs  
- Track job status in one place  
- Generate reports and export data  
- Secure role-based authentication  

### Driver
- View assigned jobs and vehicles  
- Upload daily work logs and POD images  
- Update job status in real time  

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React (Vite)  
- Material UI  
- Axios  

### Backend
- Node.js  
- Express  
- MongoDB Atlas  
- JWT Authentication  

### Storage
- Cloudinary (POD images & work diaries)  

### Security & Middleware
- CORS  
- Helmet  
- Rate limiting  
- Compression  

### Deployment
- Frontend: Vercel  
- Backend: Render  

---

## Architecture

- RESTful API design  
- MVC-style backend structure  
- Role-based access control  
- Scalable schema for future features (GPS, notifications, payroll automation)
